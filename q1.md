Interview question
==================

This is a very basic spring-boot app. Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
Try the url `http://localhost:50000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".

You should use this template to develop a course registration system.

# API Requirements
A course entity has a `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `capacity`, and `remainingPlaces`.
We would like to develop these APIs.

### Create course (POST http://localhost:50000/courses)
with body
```json
{
  "title": "Course title",
  "startDate": "2021-05-01",
  "endDate": "2021-05-05",
  "capacity": 10
}
```
Response should be 201:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Course title",
  "startDate": "2021-05-01",
  "endDate": "2021-05-05",
  "capacity": 10,
  "remaining": 10
}
```

### Search course by title (GET http://localhost:50000/courses?q=title)
Response should be 200 with body :
```json
[
  {
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Course title",
  "startDate": "2021-05-01",
  "endDate": "2021-05-05",
  "capacity": 10,
  "remaining": 10
  },
  ...
]
```
### Get course details (GET http://localhost:50000/courses/1)
Response should be 200 with body :
```json
  {
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Course title",
  "startDate": "2021-05-01",
  "endDate": "2021-05-05",
  "capacity": 10,
  "remaining": 5,
  "participants":[
    {"name":"Daniel", "registrationDate":"2021-05-01"},
    ...
  ]
  },
```

### Sign up user for course (POST http://localhost:50000/courses/1/add)
Body should be user details:
```json
{
  "courseId": 1,
  "registrationDate": "2021-04-01",
  "name": "Daniel"
}
```
Response should be: 
* 200 if registration was successful, and a response body similar to get course details request.
* 400 if `name` already enrolled to the course.
* 400 if `registrationDate` is 3 days before course `startDate` or after. i.e., if `registrationDate` greater than or equal to (`startDate` minus 3 days)
* 400 if course is full.
* 404 if course does not exist.

### Cancel user enrollment (POST http://localhost:50000/courses/1/remove)
Body should be user details:
```json
{
  "courseId": 1,
  "cancelDate": "2021-05-01",
  "name": "Daniel"
}
```
Response should be: 
* 200 if cancellation was successful, and a response body similar to get course details request.
* 404 if course does not exist or user is not enrolled to course.
* 400 if `cancelDate` is 3 days before course `startDate` or after.


#
## Guidelines
* Fork this repository and push your commits (It is better if you have  multiple commits explaining your work)
* Use the spring-boot template given
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* Write javadocs on methods when appropriate - no need for javadoc on POJOs, but on business-logic methods.
* Write unit-tests and/or integration-tests (Higher coverage is better).
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.
* You can use in memory database (h2) as your persistence layer if needed for your implementation.
* Create a maven profile "docker-image" which will build a docker image. Your code will be built by running: `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`. You can use [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for that purpose. 
* Commit your code often, it will enable us to check how you structure your work and your solution.

## Best practices
* [How to write a git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Write integration tests with [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) if appropriate.


## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* We will build your project using `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`, run the resulting image and test the api.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
