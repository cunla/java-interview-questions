Interview question
==================


This is a very basic spring-boot app. Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
Try the url `http://localhost:50000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".

There is also a package persistence which contains a basic CRUD example with persistence - this will be addressed in part 2.

# Requirements
### Part one - Basic local service
We would like to have a service that shorten URLs, i.e.:
* A REST API that takes as input a URL and gives back a short URL (hashcode perhaps?)
* A REST API that takes the short URL and gives back the original URL

#### Acceptance criteria
Sending `http://localhost:50000/short?url=https://stash.backbase.com/projects/PO/repos/payment-order-integration-spec/browse/src/main/resources/schemas/definitions.json` Should return a tiny expression (e.g., `44C0173`)

Sending `http://localhost:50000/long?tiny=44C0173` Should give back `https://stash.backbase.com/projects/PO/repos/payment-order-integration-spec/browse/src/main/resources/schemas/definitions.json`

### Part two - Adding timeout for data
In order to avoid extremely large DB, we would like to purge URLs older than 1/2 hour.
Check how to create a scheduled task in Spring to go over the DB and purge records older than 30mins.

#### Acceptance criteria
Running `http://localhost:50000/short?url=https://stash.backbase.com/projects/PO/repos/payment-order-integration-spec/browse/src/main/resources/schemas/definitions.json#38` Should return a tiny expression (e.g., `44C0173`)

Sending `http://localhost:50000/long?tiny=44C0173` **immediately** should give back `https://stash.backbase.com/projects/PO/repos/payment-order-integration-spec/browse/src/main/resources/schemas/definitions.json`

Sending `http://localhost:50000/long?tiny=44C0173` **after 1/2 hour** should give back `URL not found in DB`


## Guidelines
* Fork this repository and push your commits (It is better if you have  multiple commits explaining your work)
* Use the spring-boot template given
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* Write javadocs on methods when appropriate - no need for javadoc on POJOs, but on business-logic methods.
* Write unit-tests and/or integration-tests (Higher coverage is better).
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.
* You can use in memory database (h2) as your persistence layer if needed for your implementation.
* Create a maven profile "docker-image" which will build a docker image. Your code will be built by running: `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`. You can use [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for that purpose. 
* Commit your code often, it will enable us to check how you structure your work and your solution.

## Best practices
* [How to write a git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Write integration tests with [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) if appropriate.


## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* We will build your project using `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`, run the resulting image and test the api.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
