Interview question
==================


This is a very basic spring-boot app with web and jpa capabilities.
Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/h2-console` and login to JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:demo` with sa/password
  it should display the database DEMO with the table TBL_DEMO.

You should use this template to develop a forum system.

# Requirements
We want to develop 4 APIs:

### Post new question: `http://localhost:50000/questions`
with body:
```json
{
  "author": "Daniel",
  "message": "Message text"
}
```
Response should be 201:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "author": "Daniel",
  "message": "Message text",
  "replies": 0
}
```

### Post a reply to a message: `http://localhost:50000/questions/{questionId}/reply`
with body:
```json
{
  "author": "Reply author",
  "message": "Message reply text"
}
```
Response should be 201:
```json
{
  "questionId": 1,
  "id": 5,
  "author": "Reply author",
  "message": "Message reply text"
}
```

### Get a thread: `http://localhost:50000/questions/{questionId}`,
the response should look like:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "author": "Daniel",
  "message": "Message text",
  "replies": [
    {
       "id": 5,
       "author": "Reply author",
       "message": "Message reply text"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Get a list of questions: `http://localhost:50000/questions`
The response should look like:
```json
[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "author": "Daniel",
      "message": "Message text",     
      "replies": 0
    },
    ...
]
```


## Guidelines
* Fork this repository and push your commits (It is better if you have  multiple commits explaining your work)
* Use the spring-boot template given
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* Write javadocs on methods when appropriate - no need for javadoc on POJOs, but on business-logic methods.
* Write unit-tests and/or integration-tests using the testing libraries provided in spring-boot-starter-test (Junit 5, Mockito etc.)
  The higher coverage the better.
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.
* You can use in memory database (h2) as your persistence layer if needed for your implementation.
* Create a maven profile "docker-image" which will build a docker image. Your code will be built by running: `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`. You can use [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for that purpose. 
* Commit your code often, it will enable us to check how you structure your work and your solution.

## Best practices
* [How to write a git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Write integration tests with [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) if appropriate.


## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* We will build your project using `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`, run the resulting image and test the api.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
