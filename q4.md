Interview question
==================


This is a very basic spring-boot app with web and jpa capabilities.
Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/h2-console` and login to JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:demo` with sa/password
  it should display the database DEMO with the table TBL_DEMO.

You should use this template to develop a system to get countries currency and gini data.

# Background
https://restcountries.com/ exposes some REST API about countries information.
Try the various API endpoints to search countries by name, etc.
For example:
https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,gini
returns
```json
[
{ "name": "Afghanistan", "gini": 27.8},
{"name": "Ã…land Islands"},
{"name": "Albania","gini": 34.5},
{"name": "Algeria","gini": 35.3},
{"name": "American Samoa"},
{"name": "Andorra"},
...
]
```

# Requirements
Consume data using the API listed in https://restcountries.com/ an expose endpoints with the following requirements:

### An endpoint to retrieve the Gini Coefficient of the countries. 
Gini coefficient, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality within a nation or a social group.
- The input should be the country name. 
- The response should include the name of the country and the gini coefficient (based on the input country name filter).

### An endpoint to retrieve the countries based on the currency code
Response should be an array with a list of country names which has this currency. 


## Guidelines
* Fork this repository and push your commits (It is better if you have  multiple commits explaining your work)
* Use the spring-boot template given
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* Write javadocs on methods when appropriate - no need for javadoc on POJOs, but on business-logic methods.
* Write unit-tests and/or integration-tests using the testing libraries provided in spring-boot-starter-test (Junit 5, Mockito etc.)
  The higher coverage the better.
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.
* You can use the provided demo database (h2) as your persistence layer if needed for your implementation.
* Create a maven profile "docker-image" which will build a docker image. Your code will be built by running: `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`. You can use [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for that purpose. 
* Commit your code often, it will enable us to check how you structure your work and your solution.

## Best practices
* [How to write a git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Write integration tests with [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) if appropriate.


## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* We will build your project using `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`, run the resulting image and test the api.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
