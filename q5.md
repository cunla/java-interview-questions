Interview question
==================


This is a very basic spring-boot app with web and jpa capabilities.
Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".
* Try the url `http://localhost:50000/h2-console` and login to JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:demo` with sa/password
  it should display the database DEMO with the table TBL_DEMO.

You should use this template to develop an application for holiday planning.

# Background
We need to identity which days of the year are holidays.
We would like to create an API that given a date as input will return the closest holiday as output.

https://holidayapi.com/ API returns information about holidays during a year.

For example:
https://holidayapi.com/v1/holidays?pretty&key=c10db348-4cd2-4799-860d-e3cf84b28a0f&country=CA&year=2021

will return holidays in Canada in 2021:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "warning": "These results do not include state and province holidays. For more information, please visit https:\/\/holidayapi.com\/docs",
  "requests": {
    "used": 5,
    "available": 9995,
    "resets": "2022-09-01 00:00:00"
  },
  "holidays": [
    {
      "name": "New Year's Day",
      "date": "2021-01-01",
      "observed": "2021-01-01",
      "public": true,
      "country": "CA",
      "uuid": "1f9bc6e3-b71c-44cb-a62d-6453db68ec50",
      "weekday": {
        "date": {
          "name": "Friday",
          "numeric": "5"
        },
        "observed": {
          "name": "Friday",
          "numeric": "5"
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

# Functional Requirements
Using holidayapi.com, implement an service that will take a mandatory country code and an optional date in `YYYY-MM-DD` 
format as parameters and return the nearest holiday in the Json format below.
- When the date parameter is not provided, the service use current date as input.
- If the holidays could not be found in specified year, the service should return the nearest holiday in the next year.

```json
{
  "nearestHolidayDate": "2021-12-25",
  "holidayName": "Christmas Day"
}
```

# Non-functional Requirements
Implement cache of the holiday information retrieved from holidayapi.com to boost the performance of the service.

## Guidelines
* Create for yourself a free API key at https://holidayapi.com/pricing
* Fork this repository and push your commits (It is better if you have  multiple commits explaining your work)
* Use the spring-boot template given
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* Write javadocs on methods when appropriate - no need for javadoc on POJOs, but on business-logic methods.
* Write unit-tests and/or integration-tests using the testing libraries provided in spring-boot-starter-test (Junit 5, Mockito etc.)
  The higher coverage the better.
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.
* You can use the provided demo database (h2) as your persistence layer if needed for your implementation.
* Create a maven profile "docker-image" which will build a docker image. Your code will be built by running: `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`. You can use [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for that purpose. 
* Commit your code often, it will enable us to check how you structure your work and your solution.

## Best practices
* [How to write a git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Write integration tests with [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) if appropriate.


## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* We will build your project using `mvn clean install -Pdocker-image`, run the resulting image and test the api.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
